     <!-- These paragraphs provide a brief introduction about who I am, what I do, and my programming experience -->
      <p>
	   Hello All, My name is Catherine Barwulor and I am a junior Information Systems major here at 
	   the University of Maryland Baltimore County. I've been attending the university beginning the Fall 2014 semester and hope to graduate no later than 
	   May 2018. 
      </p>
      <p>
	   Before attending UMBC, my programming experience was nonexistent. I had no idea about the different types of programming languages that existed. 
	   It was during my second semester that I took my first class which was on Java and I continued learning about 
	   Java into the following semester. I had difficulties understanding object-oriented programming so the class wasn't my favorite and made me not a fan of
	   programming in general. But all of that is changing with the help of this class. In addition to it being interesting, it's also interactive and hands on.
	   My goal for this class is to learn a lot about developing websites. 
      </p>
      <p>
	   In addition to studying Information Systems, I'm also minoring in Spanish. I've been studying on and off spansih for the past nine years. 
	   I've a deep love and appreciation for the Spanish language and culture. I've reached a conversational level within the language but my 
	   ultimate goal is to be fluent. 
       </p>
